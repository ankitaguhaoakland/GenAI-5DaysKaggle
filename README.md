# 5 Days Gen AI with Google and Kaggle
Complete schedule along with Code Notebooks, Whitepapers to learn about Foundational Models, various LLMs, and GenAI . 

---------
## Day 1
---------
🎒 Complete the Intro Unit – “Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation”, which is:
[Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit [created by NotebookLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQDlCZZsOyo).
Read the [Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/whitepaper_Foundational%20Large%20Language%20models%20%26%20text%20generation.pdf) whitepaper.

Complete Unit 1 – “Prompt Engineering”, which is:
[Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit [created by NotebookLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_hJ2Ey4BNc).
Read the [Prompt Engineering](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/Newwhitepaper_Prompt%20Engineering_v4.pdf) whitepaper.
Complete this code lab on [Kaggle](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/day-1-prompting.ipynb) where you’ll learn prompting fundamentals. Make sure you phone verify your account before starting, it's necessary for the code labs.

💡 What You’ll Learn
Today you’ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You’ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.
The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.

🎒 Complete Unit 2: “Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases”, which is:
[Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit [created by NotebookLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CC39K76Nqs).
Read the [Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/whitepaper_Embeddings%20%26%20vector%20stores.pdf) whitepaper.

Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
i) [Build a RAG question-answering system over custom documents](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/day-2-i-document-q-a-with-rag.ipynb)
ii) [Explore text similarity with embeddings](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/day-2-ii-embeddings-and-similarity-scores.ipynb)
iii) [Build a neural classification network with Keras using embeddings](https://github.com/ankitaguhaoakland/GenAI-5DaysKaggle/blob/main/day-2-iii-classifying-embeddings-with-keras.ipynb)

💡 What You’ll Learn
Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You’ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data.

## Day 3
---------
🎒 Today’s Assignments

Complete Unit 3: “Generative AI Agents”, which is: [Optional] Listen to the summary podcast episode for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
Read the “Generative AI Agents” whitepaper.

Complete these code labs on Kaggle:
 i) Talk to a database with function calling
 ii) Build an agentic ordering system in LangGraph

💡 What You’ll Learn
Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.
